## 2015-11-11 NOTE!
## with_libpaths() is one of the functions removed (well, deprecated, for now) from
## devtools
## it's in withr now!
## see newer script below!!!

library(devtools) # with_lib(), install_github()

tmp_lib <- "~/tmp/tmp_lib"
dir.create(tmp_lib)

## upgrade or downgrade a package here
## following example is upgrading to bleeding edge devel version
with_lib(tmp_lib, install_github("codegenius/alphapkg", ref = "bleeding-edge"))
## but this could also be a downgrade to the CRAN/released version!

## restart R

## explicitly load the affected packages from the temporary library
tmp_lib <- "~/tmp/tmp_lib"
library(alphapkg, lib.loc = tmp_lib)

## your experimentation goes here

## done? clean up!
unlink(tmp_lib, recursive = TRUE)
