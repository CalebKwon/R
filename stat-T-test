# paired : 
# Paired sample t-test is a statistical technique that is used to compare two population means 
# in the case of two samples that are correlated.  Paired sample t-test is used in ‘before-after’ studies, 
# or when the samples are the matched pairs, or when it is a case-control study. 
# A paired t-test can be more powerful than a 2-sample t-test because 
# the latter includes additional variation occurring from the independence of the observations.
# A paired t-test is not subject to this variation because the paired observations are dependent. 
# Also, a paired t-test does not require both samples to have equal variance. 



# before and after training for each athlete.
# Before training: 12.9, 13.5, 12.8, 15.6, 17.2, 19.2, 12.6, 15.3, 14.4, 11.3
# After training: 12.7, 13.6, 12.0, 15.2, 16.8, 20.0, 12.0, 15.9, 16.0, 11.1

# if the means of times have remained substantially the same (hypothesis H0)
# In this case we have two sets of paired samples, since the measurements were made on the same athletes before and after the workout
t.test(a,b, paired=TRUE)   # 다르다. 향상, 퇴보 둘 다 OK

# The p-value is greater than 0.05, then we can accept the hypothesis H0 of equality of the averages.

# Now we check if there was actually an improvement, ie perform a t-test for paired data, 
# specifying in R to test the alternative hypothesis H1 of improvement in times. 
# To do this simply add the syntax alt = "less" when you call the t-test:
# 줄어 들었냐?

# a가 b보다 작은가? 
t.test(a,b, paired=TRUE, alt="less") 

# a가 b보다 큰가?
